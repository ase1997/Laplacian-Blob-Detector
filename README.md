# Laplacian-Blob-Detector

## Type: Academic Group Project

## Project Description
NCSU ECE 558 (Digital Imaging Systems) Project 2
  - Implement Laplacian blob detector for images in Python

## Dependencies:
  - numpy
  - cv2
  - time
  - matplotlib
  - Spyder IDE (used), Linux, or Anaconda on Windows 10 Education
  
## About the Repo.
  - kddo_dfmunoz_code contains **main.py** that are carefully commented.  The algortihm developed is LoG/SIFT.  The input image's size stay constant and is convoled with a Guassian kernel at different sizes
  - Final report details the implementations of the functions in this project along with the results + analysis
